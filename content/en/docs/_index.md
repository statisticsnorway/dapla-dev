## About these pages

The DAPLA documentation pages serves as a starting point and reference documentation for misc aspects of the DAPLA ecosystem. They are meant to be used as a complementary source of documentation in addition to each repository's README files, javadocs, etc. Expect to find documentation that gives an overview of how stuff works, how different components relate to each other, how-tos and reference overviews.

When creating documentation that should reside in this site, you should avoid including stuff that will be hard maintain, and you should try to keep "one source of truth" and reference the more detailed documentation in READMEs, etc instead of copying.
